# Stutern_first_project
Beginners phase project to test knowledge of SQL, pandas and data visualization
This project seeks to display my knowledge on using SQL on a database, converting the database to a pandas dataframe and visualising the dataframe using appropriate visual aids to answer specified questions on the attrition of employees in an IBM employee database. I have made the codes and comments as straight to the point as possible. Cheers!
